Alfred v2 Workflows
===================

Upload to imgur
---------------

This allows you to use a File Action to upload an image to imgur. A history.txt file is maintained in your workflow's directory that contains all links to uploaded images as well as their deletion links. Once an upload is complete the link is copied to your clipboard and then opened in your default browser.

Clean Duplicate Apps in Open With
---------------------------------

If you notice the same app listed multiple times in your "Open With" menu, run this workflow to clear them out.

Restart Dock
-------------

Run 'killall Dock' to restart the Dock process. This can often resolve weird issues such as a missing wallpaper image or dock icons that are acting up.
